Early bringup recipes that demonstrate repros for papercuts/issues in the Serpent OS tooling. Will be deleted at some point soon-ish.

## Scope
Terminal-only goodies that add value in a bootable systemd-nspawn container context. No graphical packages allowed at this stage.

The point of this repository is to have a collection of draft-quality recipes with which to flush out bugs and feature requests related to the tooling.
